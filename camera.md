# Camera Calculations
To convert the camera FOV to the focal length that is required by most equations for the remainder of this is 

$$ FOV = 2 \arctan \frac {x}{2f} $$

Alternatively to calculate the the focal length from the FOV then the equation would be:

$$ f=\frac {x} {2\tan(\frac {FOV}{2})} $$

In this equation, x is the size of the dimension of the CMOS (ideally in millimeters).
